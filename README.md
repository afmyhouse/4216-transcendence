# ft_transcendence

## Overview
`ft_transcendence` is the final project of the 42 Common Core. It aims to combine your knowledge of web development, networking, database management, and software engineering. The primary goal is to create a web application with real-time functionalities, following modern practices and secure architecture.

## Objectives
- Build a **full-stack web application** using a modern framework.
- Incorporate **real-time features**, such as a chat or game.
- Follow **best practices** in software engineering, including clean code, proper documentation, and version control.
- Implement **authentication** (OAuth, multi-factor authentication, etc.).
- Handle **data persistence** with a relational database.
- Ensure **application security** (e.g., protection against XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection).
- Design and implement a **frontend interface** that is user-friendly and responsive.
- Use **Docker** for deployment and containerization.

## Key Requirements
- Develop the application from scratch without relying on existing templates.
- Employ technologies like **Node.js**, **React**, **PostgreSQL**, or alternatives depending on the chosen stack.
- Include a **real-time component**, often fulfilled with technologies like WebSocket or Socket.IO.
- Provide a **secure authentication mechanism**.
- Host and deploy the application using **Docker containers**.

## Evaluation
- Demonstrate a working application that meets all requirements.
- Present a clear and well-documented codebase.
- Show that the project adheres to security and scalability standards.

## Tips for Success
- Plan your architecture and technologies carefully.
- Break the project into manageable sprints.
- Focus on clean and modular code.
- Regularly test your application to ensure stability.
- Document your progress and architecture decisions with tools like ADRs.
